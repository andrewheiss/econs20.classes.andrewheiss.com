## Readings

- <i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> Chapters 1 and 2 in Elinor Ostrom, *Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action* [@Ostrom:1990]
    - This one is super long and game theoretical. You can skim through lots of it (especially the mathy sections). But it's also pretty foundational to public administration, so it *is* important. Make sure you get the gist of what's happening, but *please* don't strain yourself with all the tiny details. Remember your grad school reading skillsâ€”read the introduction and conclusion, look around in the middle for things that look interesting, and make sure you understand the gist of what's going on.
