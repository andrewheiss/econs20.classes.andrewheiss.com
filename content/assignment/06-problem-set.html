<h2>1</h2>
<p>To what degree is radio broadcasting a public good? To what degree is a highway a public good? Under what conditions might these two goods be purely private or purely public? <strong>Answer in ≈30 words.</strong></p>

<h2>2</h2>
<p>In what sense is K–12 education a public good? How should your answer to this question affect the nature of government involvement in education? Make sure you use terms like “excludability” and “rivalry.” <strong>Answer in ≈30 words.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>When the state of Virginia imposed stricter regulations on air pollution in 2003, it also authorized an auction of pollution permits, allowing some plants to emit larger amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> than would otherwise be allowed, and some to emit less. Economic theory predicts that this action led to a socially efficient allocation of pollution. Describe how this outcome could occur. <strong>Answer in ≈50 words.</strong></p>

<p>If at least 26 students in the class complete this question, the entire class will get <strong>10 extra credit points</strong> (for real). If fewer than 26 students do this, nobody will get extra credit. The problem set must be turned in by the deadline to count.</p>
<p>Get a pencil and a sheet of paper. Write the following sentence, 30 times, by hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am willingly contributing to the production of this public good, even though I know that I will benefit even if I don’t participate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take a picture of this and upload it with the rest of your assignment. It must be your own handwriting. If you work on this problem set in a group, each person must upload a picture of their own sheet of paper.</p>

<p>In “The Problem of Social Cost” Coase claims that clear assignment of property rights can solve externality problems.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Why does Coase argue that from a social perspective it should not matter whether the polluter pays for pollution or whether those affected by pollution pay the polluter not to pollute? <strong>Answer in ≈30 words.</strong></li>
<li>Under what conditions does the Coase Theorem hold? When might we expect it not provide useful guidance for policy design? Why? <strong>Answer in ≈30 words.</strong></li>

<p>Construct a table like the one in <a href="https://www.core-econ.org/espp/book/text/11.html#figure-11-14">Figure 11.14 in ESPP</a> to analyze the possible market failures associated with the decisions below. In each case, identify which markets or contracts are missing or incomplete.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You inoculate your child with a costly vaccination against an infectious disease.</li>
<li>You use money that you borrow from the bank to invest in a highly risky project.</li>
<li>A fishing fleet moves from the overfished coastal waters of its own country to international waters.</li>
<li>A city airport increases its number of passenger flights by allowing nighttime departures.</li>
<li>You contribute to a Wikipedia page.</li>

<h2>7</h2>
<p>Using a nationwide survey, economists have found that the demand for refrigerators is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P = 1500 - 0.75Q
\]</span></p>
<p>Based on the internal costs of appliance manufacturers, economists have found that the marginal private cost of producing refrigerators is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P = 550 + 0.5Q
\]</span></p>
<p>A key component of the refrigerator production process is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon">chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)</a>, which helps with refrigeration. CFCs cause environmental damage, though, and economists have estimated that each refrigerator produced causes social environmental damage of <span>$220</span> during the production, lifetime, and disposal of the refrigerator (Super big hint: this will need to be added to the marginal private cost, so you should end up with <span class="math inline">\(P = 770 + 0.5Q\)</span> for your marginal social cost.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the unregulated market output and market price given the supply and demand?</li>
<li>How many refrigerators should be produced to achieve the socially optimal level? What should the market price be for this level of output?</li>
<li>How much total damage to society does this overproduction of refrigerators cause? (Hint: think about deadweight loss.)</li>
<li>One way to achieve the socially optimal level is for the government to impose a Pigouvian tax on the producers. How big of a tax should the government impose?</li>
