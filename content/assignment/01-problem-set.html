<p>Based on this information, which of the following statements regarding GDP per capita is correct? <strong>Explain why or why not in a sentence for each</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>The GDP per capita fell by 6.74% between 2013 and 2014.</li>
<li>The fall in the population was enough to offset the fall in the GDP for an overall growth in GDP per capita between 2013 and 2014.</li>

<li>Calculate the nominal GDP per capita for the United States.</li>
<li>Calculate the real GDP per capita for the United States in 2012 dollars. You shouldn’t use the CPI here. The Fed and other national agencies have a special kind of CPI-like measure for GDP called the “GDP deflator”, which is included in the dataset you downloaded. The reference year for this deflator is 2012.</li>
<li>Calculate the real GDP per capita for the United States in 2018 dollars.</li>

<p>James Madison, a leading figure in the debates about the US Constitution after the formerly British colonies in the United States of America won the war of independence, wrote in 1788:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does democracy (including the rule of law) address Madison’s concerns to oblige the government to “control itself”? (<strong>≈100 words</strong>)</p>

<p>Thailand and Cambodia produce rice and trucks at constant rates of product transformation (their possibility frontiers are straight lines—they don’t make more or less of the product depending on how much they’re currently making). In one year, Thailand could produce 1,500 tons of rice and no trucks, 500 boatloads of trucks and no rice, or any combination in between. Cambodia can produce 1,000 tons of rice or 200 boatloads of trucks, or somewhere in between. <strong>Answer the following</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draw the production possibility frontier for each country, labeling each curve and known points.</li>
<li>Thailand can produce more of both projects than Cambodia. Can Thailand gain anything by trading with Cambodia? <strong>Explain in ≈30 words.</strong></li>
<li>If the answer to #2 is yes, which ratios of trucks to rice create advantages from trade? Which ratios of trucks to rice create disadvantages from trade?</li>
