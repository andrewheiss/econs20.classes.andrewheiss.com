<p>When there is a change in the price of something, we typically change how much of it we buy. If something is a normal good, we’ll buy more of it as our income increases. If something is an inferior good, we buy less of it as our income increases.</p>
<p>We can model these changes in prices and changes in behavior with indifference curves and budget lines, which are <a href="/resource/indifference-budget/">covered in great detail in this guide here</a>.</p>
<p>The video embedded below—in addition to all these others—explains the process of doing this:</p>
