## Capitalism + governments and institutions

**You should understand…**

- …the components of the capitalist economic system: private property, markets, and firms
- …what happens when any of these components gets distorted
- …what makes public goods different from regular goods (see public goods game)
- …what institutions are and how they coordinate action
- …what GDP is, what it measures, what it doesn't measure, what problems there are with it, what alternatives there are for it, and why it continues to be popular
- …the difference between real and nominal values (and why we care)
- …what a price index is
- …what purchasing power parity (PPP) is (and also what the Big Mac Index is)
- …the downsides of capitalism (inequality + environmental damage)
- …why not everything should be a market
- …why large groups suffer from free riding and how they work to behave like small groups
- …how small factions threaten democracy, but also how they enable it
- …how voting can suffer from failures (Condorcet's paradox)

**Important formulas:**

- Adjusting for inflation:

    $$
    \text{Real} = \frac{\text{Nominal}}{\text{Price Index / 100}}
    $$

- Percent change:

    $$
    \text{% change} = \frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}}
    $$
    
    or
    
    $$
    \text{% change} = \frac{\text{Current} - \text{Previous}}{\text{Previous}}
    $$

- Compound annual growth rate (CAGR); periodic method (this assumes interest is compounded once a year; this is the harder method and you don't really need to use it):

    $$
    r = \exp(\frac{\ln(\frac{\text{Price index}_{\text{new}}}{\text{Price index}_{\text{old}}})}{t}) - 1
    $$

- Compound annual growth rate (CAGR): continuous method (this assumes interest is compounded continuously; this is the easier method and you should generally use this):

    $$
    r = \frac{\ln(\frac{\text{Price index}_{\text{new}}}{\text{Price index}_{\text{old}}})}{t}
    $$

## Social interactions, economic outcomes, and incentives

**You should understand…**

- …that perfectly rational individual behavior can create irrational and inferior social outcomes
- …how to use game theory to analyze social interactions. In particular, you should be able to define the following: game, zero-sum, Pareto efficiency, Nash equilibrium, pure strategy, mixed strategy, dominant strategy
- …what social dilemmas, collective action problems, and tragedies of the commons are
- …the difference between a stag hunt game and a prisoners dilemma game, why that difference is important, and why stag hunts are possibly a better metaphor for social dilemmas
- …what factors prevent individuals from cooperating, such as uneven payoffs, lack of assurance, preference falsification, dishonesty, and selfishness
- …how to fix collective action problems with altruism, repetition and iteration, infinitization, punishment, norms, and institutions
- …how incentives can get crowded out and distorted when extrinsic rewards or punishments replace intrinsic motivation (i.e. don't marketize important social relationships; pay enough or don't pay at all)

## Fairness and efficiency

**You should understand…** 

- …the difference between Pareto efficiency and fairness
- …why Pareto efficiency is not necessarily the best standard for measuring the success of a policy
- …how we can measure fairness with substantive standards, procedural standards, and Rawlsian standards
- …how cultural perceptions of luck and fairness shape public policy
- …how ideas of efficiency and fairness apply to international trade
- …how public policy can be used to change the payoffs in games (e.g. making it more expensive to use water and deplete public goods)
- …what elasticity measures (i.e. what it means for something to be inelastic vs. elastic)
- …why good public policies should be a Nash equilibrium
- …the difference between absolute and comparative advantage and how there can still be gains from trade if a part doesn't have absolute advantage in a product

**Guides:**

- [Absolute and comparative advantage](/resource/advantage/)

\

## Work, wellbeing, and scarcity

**You should understand…**

- …what opportunity costs are and how they influence decision making
- …how to draw a budget line and what budget lines mean
- …how utility is measured and what indifference curves are
- …the difference between the marginal rate of substitution (slope of the indifference curve) and the marginal rate of transformation (slope of the feasible frontier)
- …what it means when marginal product and marginal utility diminish
- …how to find the utility-maximizing level of consumption given preferences and budget constraints
- …the difference between normal and inferior goods
- …what income effects and substitution effects are and how they're related to government policies

**Important formulas:**

- All the ways marginal utility (or marginal rate of substitution) can be written: 

    $$
    MRS = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\text{Price}_x}{\text{Price}_y} = \frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = \frac{\partial u / \partial x}{\partial u / \partial y}
    $$

- …how firms need to be somewhat anti-competitive and anti-capitalist in order to maximize profits, innovate, and (essentially) be more competitive and capitalist

**Guides**

- [Costs](/resource/costs/)
- [Supply, demand, surplus, DWL, and elasticity](/resource/supply-demand/)
- [Monopolies](/resource/monopoly/)

**Important formulas:**

- Demand:

    $$
    P = aQ + b
    $$

- Total cost:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    TC = TFC + TVC \\
    \text{or a formula using } Q \text{, like} \\
    TC = aQ^2 + b
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Average cost:

    $$
    AC = \frac{TC}{Q}
    $$

- Marginal cost:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    MC &= \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q} \\
    &\text{or} \\
    MC &= \text{First derivative of TC} \\
    &= 2aQ \text{ (if } TC = aQ^2 + b)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Total revenue:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    TR &= PQ \\
    &\text{or} \\
    TR &= (aQ + b)Q \\
    &= aQ^2 + bQ
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Average revenue:

    $$
    AR = \frac{TR}{Q}
    $$

- Marginal revenue:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    MR &= \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q} \\
    &\text{or} \\
    MR &= \text{First derivative of TR} \\
    &= 2aQ + b \text{ (if } TR = aQ^2 + bQ)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Maximum profit:

    $$
    max(\pi): MC = MR
    $$

- Price elasticity of demand ([see this guide](/resource/costs/#elasticity-of-demand/) of how to get to $- \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}$):

    $$
    \varepsilon = -\frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demand}}{\% \text{ change in price}} = - \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}
    $$

**Important graphs:**

- Consumer surplus, producer surplus, tax revenues, tax burdens, and deadweight loss (use algebra and geometry to figure out the areas of the triangles ($\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$) and rectangles ($l \times w$)):

```{r supply-demand-surplus, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, indent="    "}
library(tidyverse)
source(here::here("lib", "graphics.R"))
